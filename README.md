### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

It's me Anissa. I have passion for learning  to dive into the world of QA software testing. I am a self-taught, devouring online resources, courses, and books, gradually mastering various testing methodologies, tools, and best practices. I'm already discovering the art of **creating test plans, executing test cases, and reporting bugs**. As I continue to expand my knowledge and gain practical experience, I  write down my journey and achievements in the **portfolio**.
